        <h2>What is blood bread?</h2>
        <p>Basically .. it's bread with added blood in the cooking process</p>
        

        <h3>
            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <p>For the preferment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>112 grams bubbly sourdough starter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lard</li>
            <li>2 oz dark beer or water</li>
            <li>300 grams high-gluten bread flour</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the final dough:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces / 1 cup sheep/pork/chicken/beef blood</li>
            <li>244 grams kernza (rye or buckwheat)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons powdered ginger</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon ground dried bergamot/wild oregano or dried marjoram</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon toasted ground  fennel seed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The night before baking, combine the preferment ingredients, mix,
                 cover, and allow to ferment overnight.
            </li>

            <li>
                The next day, mix the preferment with the final dough ingredients except 
                the salt and yeast and allow to autolyse (rest) covered at room temperature 
                for 30 minutes.
           </li>

           <li>
            Knead the salt and yeast into the dough, cover and allow to double in size.
           </li>

           <li>
            From here the dough can be refrigerated for 2-3 days, or frozen.
           </li>

           <li>
            To cook, portion the dough into 2 ounce balls, then cover with a towel and 
            proof in a warm place until puffed, and an indent in the dough doesn't spring 
            back immediately, about 45 minutes depending on how warm your kitchen is.
           </li>

           <li>
            Bake the buns at 300 for 20 minutes, or until cooked through, 
            then cool and allow to dry at room room temperature or preferably 
            in a dehydrator until completely dessicated and dried. Store the dried 
            buns in a cool dark place, I used a 2 gallon mason jar.
           </li>

           <li>
            Re-hydrating and serving
           </li>

           <li>To make four servings, take a paring knife, and put the tip into the top
             of two of the blood rolls, tap down on the knife handle like a chisel to 
             break the rolls in two, then warm 4 cups of seasoned meat stock until hot,
              but not boiling.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the bread chunks and allow to sit for 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                When the bread is fully hydrated, warm it back up to your liking.
            </li>

            <li>
                Here's my Halloween suggestion: put a ½ cup of mashed winter squash in 
                each bowl, then spoon a hunk of bread over the squash, garnish with some 
                of the juice, and scatter over some sautéed black trumpet mushrooms 
                before serving.
            </li>

                
        </ol>
