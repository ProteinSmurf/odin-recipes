        <h2>What is mead?</h2>
        <p>Mead is a fermented beverage made of honey , water and yeast.</p>

        <h3>
            Equipment
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 gallon glass carboy
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>filtered water ( or distilled )</li>
            <li>2-3 pounds of honey ( local raw honey is best )</li>
            <li>2g champagne yeast ( 1/5  -  1/2 of a 5g package )</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Instructions
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Simmer ½ gallon of water until warm.</li>
            <li>
                Add honey: 2 pounds for a dry mead or 3 pounds for a sweet mead. 
                Stir until dissolved.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer (don't boil) for about 30 minutes, skimming off any scum that forms. 
                Remove from heat and let cool to about 100°F and pour into 1 gallon carboy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add any extra ingredients you may want. See below for ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the temperature is below 90°F, add the yeast. 
                One package will make 5 gallons of mead, so use between ⅕ of a package 
                and ½ a package. I typically make two gallons at a time and divide the 
                package between the two.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cap the bottle and shake well. Add more water to fill the bottle,
                 making sure to leave 3-4 inches of headroom at the top. Take the 
                 top off and add an airlock
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the airlock is in place, set the bottle in a cool spot for about 6 weeks.
            </li>
        </ol>
